STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED:-

1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv
Ans: Downloaded the RAW data in localsystem(Windows Sys)

2. Store raw data into hdfs location
Ans: Copied the file through FileZila from Windows to Cloudera Local Sys, then using the copyFromLocal command copied the file to HDFS location
Command: "hadoop fs -copyFromLocal sales_order_data.csv destination location "

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table
Ans: use assignments;
create table sales_order_csv
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH decimal(10,2),
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES decimal(10,2),
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string ,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ',' 
tblproperties("skip.header.line.count" = "1");

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 
Ans: Start hive
hive> load data inpath 'sales_order_data.csv' into table sales_order_csv;

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"
Ans: create table sales_order_orc
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH decimal(10,2),
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES decimal(10,2),
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string ,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
stored as orc ;


6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"
Ans: Start hive
hive> from sales_order_csv insert overwrite table sales_order_orc select *;
